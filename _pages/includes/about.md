I am a Ph.D. student in [Elmore Family School of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu) and working with [Prof. Qi Guo](https://www.qiguo.org/pi). My current research focuses on computer vision and deep learning, with a particular emphasis on the joint development of novel deep learning algorithms and camera setups to optimize overall system performance across multiple tasks, such as boundary detection and depth estimation, in photon-limited environments.

Prior to Purdue, I completed my M.S. in [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/) at [Northeastern University](https://www.northeastern.edu) under the supervision of [Prof. Lawson L.S. Wong](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/lsw/). Previously, I received my B.Eng. and M.S. in Department of Process Equipment and Control Engineering at [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn), advised by [Prof. Liyan Liu](http://chemeng.tju.edu.cn/cn/szdw?type=detail&id=52).
